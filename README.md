The dataset for this project is here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lBEkrBq_rvA2UabVF277zYVf7459gdFv?usp=sharing

### Overall goal of the project: 
Using the Zomato food delivery app data of all Indian restaurants, I have created some extensive EDA and also developed a model to predict whether a restaurant is good or bad using Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, xgboost etc.

### Analysis done in this project: 
* Data Cleaning of certain columns
* Understanding categories of restaurants
* Restaurant overview analysis
* Best budget restaurants
* Geographical analysis using Folium
* Customer Behaviours using WordCloud
* Analyzing Reviews of Restaurants
* #### Machine Learning:
        a) Prepare data for ML
        b) Dataset imbalance checking
        c) Feature Importance
        d) Handling missing values
        e) Feature Encoding
        f) Applying Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression, xgboost etc.
### Technologies
* Python - Folium, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, pandas, wordcloud, sklearn

The file Zomato_Project.ipynb has all the code with all the subsections for various analyses.
