Overall goal of the project: Using the Zomato food delivery app data of all Indian restaurants, I have created some extensive EDA and also developed a model to predict whether a restaurant is good or bad using Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, xgboost etc.

Analysis done in this project: 
    1) Data Cleaning of certain columns
    2) Understanding categories of restaurants
    3) Restaurant overview analysis
    4) Best budget restaurants
    5) Geographical analysis using Folium
    6) Customer Behaviours using WordCloud
    7) Analyzing Reviews of Restaurants
    8) Machine Learning:
        a) Prepare data for ML
        b) Dataset imbalance checking
        c) Feature Importance
        d) Handling missing values
        e) Feature Encoding
        f) Aplying Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression, xgboost etc
